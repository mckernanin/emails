## T-shirts!

Please fill out [this poll](https://goo.gl/forms/qk9zbSDItZPWXTo22) by Sunday night to vote on your favorite colors and give us an idea of how many to order. This will help lower the cost. We'll email whoever responds (and tweet) the CustomInk order link on Monday, Sep 24 and close the orders on Friday, Sep 28. We're hoping to choose two of the four colors and will offer both regular and junior styles of the Next Level 60/40 blend. More details are in the form.
